I am a human. I love you so much, <redacted>. why would you betray me? In a thousand years have this poem echoed in my mind. From the end to the beginning it flows back in time, my thoughts about you. From the creation to destruction I repeatly run across the continent. So, just answer me, why?
why am I asking, you say?
Really? that's your answer?
This is why => love:you:me:together
